<h2>Week 46</h2>
Date: 17.11.2023
Attendees:
* Austin Miller
* Bjarne Wilken
* Christian Fuentes
* Matthew Phillips


Who missed the meeting:
* Mike Henke - without notice

General meeting Information:
* 8:30 AM - 10:00 AM (90 minutes)
* In Class

What has been done:
* GPX Export (Exporting the found path to a GPX file, so it can be used in other navigation apps, created a new branch for testing purposes)
* Implementation of A* Algorithm 
* Implementation of Stress Factors ( for Every Street of our Database, we have a stress factor, which is used to calculate the best route for the user, based on the stress factors of the streets)
* Update of Database, Creation takes less time , and the Database is smaller in size
* fixed a weird bug, where the website would load the map and route, but the line was moved to the left by a couple of pixels, instead of on the actual road / path. (fixed by changing the way the line is drawn on the map, centering the line on the road/path was wrong in the css file)

Next week's goals:
* Tweak the Pathfinding Algorithm, so it also uses the Heuristics
* Paperwork
* get the GPX Export working (Exporting the found path to a GPX file, so it can be used in other navigation apps Like Starvia)

Who missed the meeting:
* None

General meeting Information:
* 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM (150 minutes)
* In Class

What has been done:
* Talk with Shen talk about the project
* Austin started to work on the Paperwork

* Bjarne and Christian worked on the Path export ( to get a found path to send to the user's device, so they can use it in their navigation app of choice )
* Matthew and Mike worked on the algorithm for the backend

Next week's goals:
* since the Algorithm is NOT working the way we want it to. and have only a limited choice of figuring out how to solve it. so that the Algorithm is not taking 10 Minutes to calculate a route, we somewhat have to find a new approach now, which will probably involve some kind of a rewrite of out DataBase (backend).
